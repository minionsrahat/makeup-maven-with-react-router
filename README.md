- First of all i create a  json file for fake review data. Then i developed a custom hook for loading those data.
- In the custom hook json data are loaded using useEffect hook.When json data are successfully loaded then i display the array using map function.
- For displaying only 3 reviews in home page i use array.slice method.
- For active navigation link i use NavLink component from react router.
