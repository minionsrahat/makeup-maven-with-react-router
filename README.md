## Description

Makeup Maven is a simple, single-page makeup tool website designed for women. It consists of several sections including home, reviews, dashboard, blogs, and about.

To create this website, the following steps were taken:

- Created a JSON file for fake review data.
- Developed a custom hook for loading the review data using the `useEffect` hook.
- Displayed the review data using the `map` function after successfully loading the JSON data.
- Implemented a functionality to display only 3 reviews on the home page using the `array.slice` method.
- Created a dashboard with different types of charts, including a line chart, an area chart, a stacked bar chart, and a composite chart with axes labels.
- Utilized the `NavLink` component from React Router for active navigation links.
